\section*{Notes}

{\it 
Please keep the following in mind:

\begin{itemize}

\item This template is to be completed for each paper discussed in class.

\item The summary for the in class paper discussion, i.e., all sections in this
template combined, should be between half a page (i.e., one column) and a full
page (i.e., two columns) in length.

\item As with your paper summary, the emphasis in grading will
be on the parts of the discussion summary where you critically think about
the paper and make connections with other work. Specifically,
class discussion summaries will be graded as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item Summary: 40\%

\item Strengths and weaknesses: 20\%

\item Connection with other work: 20\%

\item Ideas for future work: 20\%

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section*{Discussion summary}

in the class, or your own new insights, regarding the strengths and
weaknesses of the paper(s).

\item {\it Connection with other work:} Describe any connections that were made in
the class discussion to other papers (with citations). (Or connections that you realized
as a result of the class discussion.)

for future work that came out of the discussion and/or were triggered
in your mind because of the discussion.
