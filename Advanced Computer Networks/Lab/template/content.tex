\section{Introduction}

Where you will motivate what problem you
addressed and why that is important. {\bf Here the problem being
addressed is not to teach you about Mininet and/or SDN, but the
security problem addressed by the Random Host Mutation 
approach~\cite{random.host.mutation}.} Since we can not claim
the idea, however, you'd have to cite that work in the
introduction and say something to effect that you reproduced a part of the
paper for this assignment.

\section{Design}

Here you would briefly describe details of
your approach \emph{at the architectural level}. How did you
do the DNS mapping? Did you use an external controller? How
did you implement the DNS functionality? 

This would be a good section in which to provide a figure
to explain what you have done.

\section{Implementation}

Here you would briefly describe the actual
implementation. Here you would say which controller platform
you used, what language the implementation was in etc.

\section{Results}

Here you will present some results to show that your implementation
was functional. Figures (e.g., time series, distribution plots etc) and
tables are in general good ways to present your results. Be sure to
have accompanying text that describe each result that you present.
Actual results will of course depend on the content of your report.

\section{Discussion}

Here you would discuss the pros and cons of your
approach. Specifically, you might want to point out limitations
of the architectural approach in general (i.e., essentially what was proposed
in~\cite{random.host.mutation}), as well as limitations of your
own implementation. This would also be a good place to suggest
``future work''. I.e., how some of these limitations might be addressed
etc.
